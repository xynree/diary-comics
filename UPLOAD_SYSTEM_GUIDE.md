# Diary Comics Automated Upload System

## üéØ Overview

The automated upload system provides a comprehensive solution for uploading diary comic images to Cloudinary with features like:

- **File System Monitoring**: Real-time watching of local directories
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient upload of multiple files
- **Duplicate Detection**: Smart handling of duplicate files
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars and detailed logging
- **CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line tools

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Cloudinary account with API credentials
- Environment variables configured in `.env.local`:

```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Optional: Set default watch folder
DIARY_WATCH_FOLDER=/path/to/your/diary/images
```

### 2. Installation

The upload system is already included in the project. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configuration

Check system status:

```bash
npm run upload:status
```

Add a watch folder:

```bash
npm run upload:config -- --add-folder /path/to/your/diary/images
```

### 4. Basic Usage

**Manual Upload:**

```bash
npm run upload -- /path/to/images
```

**Start File Watcher:**

```bash
npm run upload:watch
```

**Validate Files:**

```bash
npm run upload:validate -- /path/to/images
```

## üìã Commands Reference

### Status Command

```bash
npm run upload:status
```

Shows system configuration, Cloudinary connection status, and watch folder information.

### Configuration Commands

```bash
# Show current configuration
npm run upload:config -- --show

npm run upload:config -- --remove-folder /path/to/folder

# Set duplicate handling strategy
npm run upload:config -- --set-duplicate-handling skip|overwrite|rename

# Reset to defaults
npm run upload:config -- --reset
```

### Upload Commands

```bash
# Upload files/directories
npm run upload -- /path/to/images

# Upload with options
npm run upload -- /path/to/images --recursive --force

# Dry run (show what would be uploaded)
npm run upload -- /path/to/images --dry-run

# Skip duplicates
npm run upload -- /path/to/images --skip-duplicates

# Overwrite duplicates
npm run upload -- /path/to/images --overwrite-duplicates
```

### Watch Mode

```bash
# Start watching configured directories
npm run upload:watch

# Process existing files immediately
npm run upload:watch -- --immediate
```

### Validation

```bash
# Validate files without uploading
npm run upload:validate -- /path/to/images

# Validate recursively
npm run upload:validate -- /path/to/images --recursive
```

## üìÅ File Requirements

### Naming Convention

Files must follow the format: `M.D.YY_sequence.extension`

Examples:

- `1.1.25_1.jpg` (January 1, 2025, sequence 1)
- `12.31.24_3.png` (December 31, 2024, sequence 3)

### Supported Formats

- jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp, bmp, tiff

### File Size Limits

- Minimum: 1 KB
- Maximum: 10 MB

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Duplicate Handling

The system automatically detects files that already exist in Cloudinary and handles them intelligently:

- **skip**: Skip files that already exist (default and recommended)
- **overwrite**: Replace existing files (use with caution)
- **rename**: Create new files with unique names

**Simple & Fast**: The system checks if a file with the same name already exists in Cloudinary. If it exists, it follows your configured strategy (skip by default). No complex hash comparisons - just filename-based detection for maximum performance.

### Batch Processing

- **Batch Size**: Number of files processed simultaneously (default: 5)
- **Retry Attempts**: Number of retry attempts for failed uploads (default: 3)
- **Retry Delay**: Delay between retries in milliseconds (default: 1000)

### Logging

- **Log Level**: debug, info, warn, error (default: info)
- **Log to File**: Enable/disable file logging (default: true)
- **Log File Path**: Location of log files (default: ./logs/upload.log)

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Configuration File

The system uses `~/.diary-upload-config.json` for persistent configuration. You can manually edit this file for advanced settings.

### Environment Variables

Override configuration with environment variables:

- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`

### Programmatic Usage

You can also use the upload system programmatically:

```typescript
import { UploadService } from "./scripts/services/uploadService";
import { uploadConfig } from "./scripts/config/uploadConfig";

const config = uploadConfig.getConfig();
const uploadService = new UploadService(config);

// Upload a single file
const result = await uploadService.uploadFile("/path/to/image.jpg");

// Upload multiple files
const results = await uploadService.uploadFiles([
  "/path/to/image1.jpg",
  "/path/to/image2.png",
]);
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Cloudinary credentials not set"**

- Ensure `.env.local` file exists with correct credentials
- Check that environment variables are properly formatted

**2. "No valid files found"**

- Verify files follow the naming convention `M.D.YY_sequence.extension`
- Check file formats are supported (jpg, png, etc.)
- Ensure files meet size requirements (1KB - 10MB)

**3. "Watch folder does not exist"**

- Verify the folder path is correct and accessible
- Use absolute paths when possible

**4. "Upload failed with network error"**

- Check internet connection
- Verify Cloudinary credentials are correct
- Check if Cloudinary service is available

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for detailed information:

```bash
npm run upload:config -- --set-log-level debug
```

### Log Files

Check log files for detailed error information:

- Default location: `./logs/upload.log`
- Logs include timestamps, error details, and stack traces

### Validation Issues

Use the validate command to check files before uploading:

```bash
npm run upload:validate -- /path/to/images
```

This will show detailed validation errors for each file.

## üìä Monitoring & Statistics

### Upload Statistics

The system provides detailed statistics after each upload:

- Total files processed
- Success/failure counts
- Average upload time
- Success rate percentage

### Progress Tracking

- Real-time progress bars during uploads
- ETA calculations for batch operations
- File-by-file status updates

### Logging

- Structured logging with different levels
- File and console output
- Automatic log rotation when files get too large

## üîí Security

### API Credentials

- Store credentials in `.env.local` (not committed to version control)
- Use environment variables in production
- Regularly rotate API keys

### File Validation

- All files are validated before upload
- Only supported image formats are processed
- File size limits prevent abuse

### Error Handling

- Graceful handling of network failures
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Detailed error logging for debugging

## üöÄ Performance Tips

1. **Batch Size**: Adjust batch size based on your internet connection
2. **Concurrent Uploads**: The system limits concurrent uploads to prevent overwhelming the API
3. **File Size**: Optimize images before upload to reduce transfer time
4. **Watch Mode**: Use watch mode for continuous monitoring instead of manual uploads

## üìù Support

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review log files for detailed error information
3. Use the validation command to identify file issues
4. Check Cloudinary dashboard for upload status
