```bash
vercel login
```

### **Step 3: Set Environment Variables**
In Vercel dashboard, add these environment variables:

**Production Environment Variables:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=xynree
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=xynree
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_production_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_production_api_secret
SITE_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
```

### **Step 4: Deploy to Preview**
```bash
npm run deploy:preview
```

### **Step 5: Deploy to Production**
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Build Failures:**
- Check TypeScript errors: `npm run build`
- Verify all dependencies installed: `npm install`
- Check environment variables are set

**Image Loading Issues:**
- Verify Cloudinary credentials
- Check image URLs in browser network tab
- Confirm folder structure in Cloudinary

**API Errors:**
- Check Cloudinary API limits
- Verify environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Check function timeout settings

### **Monitoring & Logs**
- Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Function logs available in Vercel dashboard
- Use `vercel logs` command for recent logs

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

The project is configured for automatic deployment:
- Push to `main` branch triggers production deployment
- Pull requests create preview deployments
- All deployments run tests before going live

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

### **Recommended Tools**
- Vercel Analytics (built-in)
- Google PageSpeed Insights
- Lighthouse CI
- Sentry for error tracking

### **Key Metrics to Monitor**
- Page load time
- API response time
- Image loading performance
- Error rates
- User engagement

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### **Implemented Security Features**
- Security headers (CSP, XSS protection, etc.)
- Environment variable protection
- API rate limiting (via Vercel)
- HTTPS enforcement

### **Regular Security Tasks**
- Update dependencies monthly
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Review access logs
- Rotate API keys annually

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### **Regular Maintenance Tasks**
- Monitor Cloudinary usage and costs
- Update dependencies
- Review performance metrics
- Backup configuration files

### **Emergency Procedures**
- Rollback: Use Vercel dashboard to revert to previous deployment
- Hotfix: Create emergency branch and deploy directly
- Monitoring: Set up alerts for downtime or errors
